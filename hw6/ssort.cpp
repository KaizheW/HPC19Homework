  // send-counts and send-displacements to each process. Determining the
  // bins for an already sorted array just means to determine these

  // send-displacement for the message to process (i+1) is then given by,
  // sdispls[i+1] = std::lower_bound(vec, vec+N, s[i]) - vec;

  // send and receive: first use an MPI_Alltoall to share with every
  // process how many integers it should expect, and then use
  // MPI_Alltoallv to exchange the data

  // do a local sort of the received data

  // every process writes its result to a file
